By reading the questions carefully and giving some time to think about the solution and writing your idea on a piece of paper and then implementing it. 
Directly jumping to coding after reading the question will not be much beneficial in a long run as you will not get access to your ideas 
in future if you want to revise it.
And practising daily atleast 3 questions will surely give you result after some months of coding.
